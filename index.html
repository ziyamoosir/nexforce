            A.R. Rahman, often referred to as the "Mozart of Madras," is an internationally acclaimed Indian composer, singer, and music producer. Born on January 6, 1967, in Chennai (formerly Madras), India, Rahman is known for his work in the Indian film industry, as well as in international cinema and music.
            
            Early Life:
            Rahman, born as Allah Rakha Rahman, showed an interest in music from an early age. His father was a composer, and he was influenced by various musical traditions, including Indian classical, Western classical, and world music. After his father's death, Rahman turned to music more seriously. He initially studied at the Madras Conservatory of Music and later trained under renowned musicians in both Western and Indian classical music.
            
            Career:
            Rahmanâ€™s breakthrough in the film industry came with the soundtrack of the 1992 Tamil film Roja, directed by Mani Ratnam. The album was a huge success, earning Rahman recognition as a talented new composer in Indian cinema. He quickly became known for his unique blend of classical music with electronic music, world rhythms, and innovative arrangements.
            
            Following Roja, Rahman went on to create music for numerous other films, both in Tamil and Hindi, such as Dil Se, Taal, Lagaan, and Guru. His soundtracks for Bollywood and Tamil cinema earned him widespread acclaim, and his music became an essential part of the Indian film experience.</p></div>
